I just want us to set up and make the charts of Accounts work. Then lay out and implement the basic features of the application. The charts of accounts is first because the basic features as below (Data Management) cannot work without the charts. After these are done, we can now bring in others like Advance AI and LLM and NLP.
I understand that we need to prioritize implementing the Chart of Accounts functionality first, as it's the foundation of the entire system. Let me fix the current database initialization issues and then implement the core Chart of Accounts features.
