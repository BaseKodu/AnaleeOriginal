Here's how to implement **report generation** and **exporting the trial balance** for your prototype. 

---

## **1. Report Generation (Trial Balance)**

### **Purpose**
The trial balance summarizes the data in a structured format. It groups transactions by accounts (from the `Analysis` column) and calculates totals for each account.

---

### **Database Adjustments**
Ensure the `BankStatement` and `ChartOfAccounts` models are configured as described earlier.

---

### **Route for Trial Balance**
Add a route to generate and display the trial balance in `routes.py`:
```python
@main_bp.route('/trial_balance', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def trial_balance():
    # Fetch user's transactions grouped by 'Analysis'
    data = BankStatement.query.filter_by(user_id=current_user.id).all()

    # Prepare trial balance data
    trial_balance = {}
    for row in data:
        if row.analysis:
            if row.analysis not in trial_balance:
                trial_balance[row.analysis] = 0
            trial_balance[row.analysis] += row.amount

    # Sort by account names
    trial_balance = dict(sorted(trial_balance.items()))

    return render_template('trial_balance.html', trial_balance=trial_balance)
```

---

### **Template for Trial Balance Page (`trial_balance.html`)**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Trial Balance</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Trial Balance</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Account</th>
                <th>Total</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            {% for account, total in trial_balance.items() %}
            <tr>
                <td>{{ account }}</td>
                <td>{{ total }}</td>
            </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        </tbody>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## **2. Exporting the Trial Balance**

### **Purpose**
Allow the user to download the trial balance as a CSV or Excel file.

---

### **Install Required Library**
Install the `openpyxl` library to handle Excel exports:
```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

---

### **Route for Exporting Trial Balance**
Add the export route to `routes.py`:
```python
import pandas as pd
from flask import send_file

@main_bp.route('/export_trial_balance', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def export_trial_balance():
    # Fetch user's transactions grouped by 'Analysis'
    data = BankStatement.query.filter_by(user_id=current_user.id).all()

    # Prepare trial balance data
    trial_balance = {}
    for row in data:
        if row.analysis:
            if row.analysis not in trial_balance:
                trial_balance[row.analysis] = 0
            trial_balance[row.analysis] += row.amount

    # Convert to DataFrame for export
    trial_balance_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(
        trial_balance, orient='index', columns=['Total']
    ).reset_index().rename(columns={'index': 'Account'})

    # Save as Excel
    output_file = 'trial_balance.xlsx'
    trial_balance_df.to_excel(output_file, index=False)

    # Serve the file to the user
    return send_file(output_file, as_attachment=True)
```

---

### **Add Download Button in Trial Balance Page**
Modify `trial_balance.html` to include a button for downloading the trial balance:
```html
<form action="{{ url_for('main.export_trial_balance') }}" method="get">
    <button type="submit">Download Trial Balance</button>
</form>
```

---

## **3. Complete Workflow**

### **Trial Balance Features**
1. **View Trial Balance**:
   - Navigate to the `/trial_balance` route.
   - Display totals for each account (e.g., from the `Analysis` column).

2. **Download Trial Balance**:
   - Click the "Download Trial Balance" button.
   - The trial balance is generated dynamically and served as an Excel file.

---

### **Testing Steps**
1. Upload sample data (e.g., CSV file with `Date`, `Description`, and `Amount`).
2. Fill in the `Explanation` and `Analysis` fields in the **Analyze Data** page.
3. Visit the **Trial Balance** page to view totals grouped by account.
4. Click the **Download Trial Balance** button to export the data as an Excel file.

### **Sample Trial Balance Data**
| Account       | Total    |
|---------------|----------|
| Office Supplies | 200.50  |
| Travel         | 500.00  |
| Rent           | 1500.00 |
