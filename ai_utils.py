Transaction Details:
- Description: {description}

1. Consider both the transaction description and additional explanation equally
2. Account for the account categories and sub-categories in your analysis
3. Provide confidence scores based on:
   - Match with similar historical transactions
   - Clarity of the description and explanation
   - Alignment with account categories
4. Explain your reasoning considering accounting principles

Format your response as a JSON list with exactly this structure:
[
    {{"account_name": "suggested account name", "confidence": 0.95, "reasoning": "detailed explanation including category consideration"}},
    {{"account_name": "alternative account", "confidence": 0.75, "reasoning": "explanation of why this is an alternative match"}}
]

Provide up to 3 suggestions, ranked by confidence (0 to 1). Focus on accuracy over quantity."""
